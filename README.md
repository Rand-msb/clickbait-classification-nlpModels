# clickbait-classification-nlpModels
## Description
This project aimed to investigate the relationship between emotions and clickbait headlines, 
hypothesizing that clickbait headlines use exaggerated emotional language to grab attention 
while non-clickbait headlines do not. We used various NLP and ML techniques to create a 
variation of the clickbait dataset that includes an emotion column, preprocess the text input to 
be suitable for entering the classification models using word2vec embedding and RoBERTa 
tokenization, classify the headline with and without the emotion feature using the SVM 
classification model, and evaluate different models on the best dataset, which was the one 
without the "emotion" feature. This might suggest that the existing features in the dataset are 
already informative enough for classification. However, there may be other types of features or 
representations that could be explored in future work to further enhance the accuracy of the 
model. One promising approach could be to incorporate a different model for adding emotional 
features to the dataset. By exploring different models and approaches, it may be possible to 
improve the effectiveness of clickbait classification and gain further insights into the role of 
emotions in headline language

I provided the colab fils  for the text classification , add the emotion column and all datasets used in the project
